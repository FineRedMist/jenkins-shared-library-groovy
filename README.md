# JenkinsLibrarySample

This is a sample library that factors out common functionality for building C# projects for [jenkins-project-sample-dotnet](https://github.com/FineRedMist/jenkins-project-sample-dotnet)

# Revisiting Objectives

I have read [DRY Gone Bad--Bespoke Company Frameworks](https://aaronstannard.com/dry-gone-bad-bespoke-company-framework/), and I am rethinking my approach for this to decouple the project into smaller components. A couple of other factors are also motivating this thinking. Moving this functionality into a Jenkins plugin would facilitate a greater degree of functionality, and in particular, the opportunity to more easily build tests around this script (or eventually, script components). Though honestly, I'm not enthusiastic about Jenkins and some of the strange issues I've encountered.

# Configuration

The script is driven by a Configuration.json that is in the root of the repository. The expected values are:
* Version: Typically a x.y.z version (trailing zeroes optional).
* ScmTrigger: [optional] The frequency to poll source control for changes.
* RunTests: [optional, default true] Whether to build the TestBuildConfiguration and run tests & code coverage against it.
* TestBuildConfiguration: [optional, default debug] The build configuration to use for building and running tests, code coverage, static analysis, etc.
* AdditionalBuildArtifacts: [optional, default not set] Additional files to store as build [artifacts](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/core/#archiveartifacts-archive-the-artifacts) for debugging using ANT paths, comma separated.
* Nuget Configuration Options
    * NugetSource: [optional] The nuget repository to push nuget packages to. If not set, it will not be queried or pushed to.
    * NugetKeyCredentialsId: [optional] The credentials for pushing to a nuget repository. If not set, nuget will not be queried or pushed to.
    * NugetBuildConfiguration: [optional, default: release] The build configuration to use for building the nuget package.
* Slack Configuration Options
    * SlackChannel: [optional] The Slack channel to post build status messages to. If not set, it will use the default channel as part of the general Slack configuration.
    * SendSlack: [optional, default true] Whether to send Slack messages.
    * SendSlackStartNotification: [optional, default true] Whether to send the build start notification to Slack.
* GitHub Configuration Options
    * GitHubStatusName: [optional] The status name for custom GitHub status names. If not set, they will not be sent (and rely on Jenkins built in notifications).
    * GitHubStatusCredentialsId: [optional] The credentials to use for updating the GitHub status. If not set, they will not be sent (and rely on Jenkins built in notifications).
* Coverage Thresholds [optional]
    * This field is a map representing thresholds passed to [publishCoverage](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/code-coverage-api/)
    * The default value of 'CoverageThresholds' is:

```json
[
    {
        "thresholdTarget": "Group",
        "unhealthyThreshold": 100.0
    },
    {
        "thresholdTarget": "Package", 
        "unhealthyThreshold": 100.0
    },
    {
        "thresholdTarget": "File", 
        "unhealthyThreshold": 50.0, 
        "unstableThreshold": 85.0
    },
    {
        "thresholdTarget": "Class", 
        "unhealthyThreshold": 50.0, 
        "unstableThreshold": 85.0
    },
    {
        "thresholdTarget": "Method", 
        "unhealthyThreshold": 50.0, 
        "unstableThreshold": 85.0
    },
    {
        "thresholdTarget": "Instruction", 
        "unhealthyThreshold": 0.0, 
        "unstableThreshold": 0.0
    },
    {
        "thresholdTarget": "Line", 
        "unhealthyThreshold": 50.0, 
        "unstableThreshold": 85.0
    },
    {
        "thresholdTarget": "Conditional", 
        "unhealthyThreshold": 0.0, 
        "unstableThreshold": 0.0
    }
]
```

Extra configuration:
 * There is an expectation that a 'NuGet-2022' tool defined that points to the nuget executable.
